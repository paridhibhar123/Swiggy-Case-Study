The Swiggy Case Study project applies SQL queries to evaluate customer behavior, restaurant performance, and operational efficiency. The analysis includes filtering customers by location, identifying active and inactive users, calculating restaurant average ratings, and ranking the top 5 highest-rated restaurants. Order data was used to track total revenue per restaurant, number of orders by customer and city, and recent 30-day ordering patterns. Advanced queries identified customers ordering on exactly three different days and the delivery partner who has served the most unique customers. These insights enable targeted strategies to boost customer engagement, enhance restaurant partnerships, and improve delivery efficiency. The project demonstrates strong SQL skills in aggregation, filtering, grouping, and business-oriented data analysis.
